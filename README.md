# DiscordBot#1
a discord bot made with love using the Discord.NET library.

The Models folder contain a c# class named Commands.cs this class where you implement your custom methods for the bot.
I also create a Model named Card.cs for better understaing. 

Please don't charge the server with many requests or your IP will be banned. and to prevent that that i set a "await Task.Delay(1000)" for every request.
